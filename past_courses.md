subtitle: Some course notes after I decided to study "Properly"

Follwing are my summaries/notes I wrote for the courses I am currently taking or have taken. Good for review purposes. If you are new to them probably you can never understand them LOL. 

Some of them are not complete since I am currently taking it.

Most of them are in latex, however, some are in Markdown because I was trying to practice my Markdown skills.

I get lazy sometimes, especially for the project-based courses where there was not much to summarize. So courses like CPEN311 and CPEN412 are not included here since I did not take notes for them.

## CPEN Courses

- [CPEN212 Computing Systems II](courses/CPEN212/Summary/Summary.pdf).
- [CPEN221 Principles of Software Construction](courses/CPEN221/Summary/Summary.pdf).
- [CPEN355 ML basics](courses/CPEN355/Summary/Summary.pdf).
- [CPEN411 Computer Architecture](courses/CPEN411/Summary/Summary.pdf).
<!-- - CPEN311 and CPEN412 are more of a project-based course, so I don't have notes for them. But do check out my tetris game on [prject](/projects) page. It was quite fun to make. -->
