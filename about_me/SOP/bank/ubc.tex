I have been in UBC for 4 years and I still love the school and the courses offered here.

I am familiar with the campus, the professors, the courses, and the research projects. I have been involved in a research project with Prof. Alexandra Fedorova for the past year and I would like to continue the research with the professors that I know, and the professors that know me.

I have already taken few grad level course in ECE and I really enjoyed the courses. I would like to take more grad level courses in the future.

The research experience I had with Prof. Alexandra Fedorova has been great. I have learned a lot from the project and I would like to continue the research in the future.
