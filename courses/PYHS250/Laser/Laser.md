## Photon Absorption/Emission Probability

???

## Stimulated Emission

Let $E_{\gamma} = E_B-E_A$ be the energy of the photon. Atom with $E_A$ is excited to $E_B$ by absorbing a photon. 

A photon with energy $E_{\gamma}$ can hit an excited atom with $E_B$ and cause it to emit a photon with energy $E_{\gamma}$.

$$
E_B + E_{\gamma} \rightarrow E_A + E_{\gamma} + E_{\gamma}
$$

The direction of the emitted photon is the same as the incoming photon. The two photons are **coherent**.

### chain reaction

Ground state atoms can absorb photons and get excited. Excited atoms can emit photons and return to the ground state.

Thus we need more atoms in the excited state than in the ground state. This is called **population inversion**.

## Optical pumping

Optical pumping is a method to create population inversion. We shine light on the atoms to excite them. The excited atoms can emit photons and return to the ground state.

### 3-level system

- Level 1: Ground state
- Level 2: Excited state
- Level 3: Metastable state

Start with high population in level 1. Excite the atoms to level 3. Fast spontaneours decay to level 2. Stimulated emission to level 1 if spontaneous decay is slow on level 2.

This way we can get more atoms in level 2 than in level 1.

### 4-level system

- Level 1: Ground state
- Level 2: Excited state with short lifetime
- Level 3: Excited state with long lifetime
- Level 4: Metastable state

This way, we can leave the ground state population high and still get population inversion between level 2 and level 3. Much more efficient and easier to maintain.

## Gas Discharge Laser

- Gas is excited by an electric discharge.
- Often atoms of one gas are exited and transfer their exictation to atoms of another gas, which does the actual lasing. This is called a **transfer laser**.

## Frequency Doubling

Some crystals are "non-linear". There is significant dependence of their index of refraction on the intensity of light.

In quantum mechanics, it means they absorb two photons and emit one photon with twice the energy (half the wavelength).
