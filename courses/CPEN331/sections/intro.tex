\begin{frame}{Review of VM and address translation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Virtual memory (VM) is a technique that allows an operating system to give processes the illusion that they have exclusive access to the entire address space.
    \item The operating system can then use the hardware to map the virtual addresses to physical addresses.
    \item This mapping is done in pages, which are typically 4KB in size.
    \item The hardware maintains a page table that maps virtual pages to physical pages.
    \item The page table is stored in memory and is managed by the operating system.
  \end{itemize}
